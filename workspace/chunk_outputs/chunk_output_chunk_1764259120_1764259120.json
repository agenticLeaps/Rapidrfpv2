Executive Summaryummary of your understanding of Beebe’s system objectives and how your proposed solution will meet these objectives.Based on our understanding of the requirements, Beebe Healthcare has a strategic plan aimed at delivering exceptional healthcare to Sussex County communities. To achieve this vision, Beebe recognizes the importance of a robust and integrated information technology (IT) ecosystem, referred to as One Beebe, which will benefit patients, families, providers, and staff. The current IT ecosystem requires significant enhancements to align with Beebe's strategic plan, support its growth and development over the next 3 to 5 years and beyond, and adapt to the future of healthcare.Beebe's executive leadership acknowledges that the organization's position as an independent regional healthcare system relies heavily on the capabilities of its IT ecosystem. While some components of the current system have been in place for an extended period, they may have shortcomings. To leverage the potential of new disruptive technologies that can enhance Beebe's capabilities, it is crucial for Beebe to proactively enhance its IT ecosystem.Therefore, Beebe seeks to incorporate innovative technologies that can act as catalysts for transformative healthcare change, leading to a distinctive One Beebe experience for both patients and providers. Beebe expects these innovations to be easily accessible not only to their known patients and providers but also to the wider community, enabling broad engagement with One Beebe healthcare and services. Brief summary of the proposal in non-technical terms.Andor Health is delighted to respond to the RFI titled Strategic System Selection - Innovation. We are eager to demonstrate our ability to meet and exceed the requirements as defined in the RFI by Beebe Healthcare.Andor Health was born 4 years ago with a single mission; to fundamentally change the way in which care teams, patients, and families connect and collaborate. By harnessing the latest innovations in OpenAI/ChatGPT and transformative generative AI/ML models, our cloud-based platform unlocks data stored in source systems, such as electronic medical records, to deliver real-time actionable intelligence to care teams within ubiquitous care team collaboration platforms like Microsoft Teams. By perfecting communication workflows, our platform accelerates time to treatment, decreases clinician burnout, and drives better patient outcomes.For over 20 years, our leadership team has placed intense focus on pioneering technologies for patients, creating more collaborative experiences for clinicians, using innovative devices, and driving evolution to mobile self-service. Healthcare institutions and care teams use ThinkAndor® to enable providers to configure patient and clinician interactions with ubiquitous team collaboration platforms. This eliminates the need to manage added applications. ThinkAndor® enables a frictionless virtual interaction allowing physicians and patients to communicate without being distracted by disjointed technologies during a virtual consultation. ThinkAndor is the only integrated virtual collaboraiton platform that can truly integrate all aspects of ambulatory, acute, post-acute and at home virtual care collaboration through our 5 Pillars of Virtual Health: Virtual Visits, Virtual Rounding, Virtual Patient Monitoring, Virtual Team Collaboration, and Virtual Community Collaboration.Andor Health is partnered with over 40 health systems across the US, Uk, and Canada, with over 70,000 providers and 300 hospitals leveraging the Andor Health platform globally, and ThinkAndor is the only virtual collaboration platform deployed AT SCALE. National Institutes of Health, Orlando Health, Tampa General, Medical University of South Carolina, and NHS, are among some of the most notable. You may find a list of our strategic partners by accessing this link. Moreover we have several distinct strategic partnerships and integrations, we have integrated to multiple EMR’s including being a top tier partner Epic Connection Hub (App Orchard) partner, Cerner (CODE development partner), and Athena MDP partner which allow ThinkAndor to discretely integrate data and workflows to remain fundamentally aligned with any back end data sources at Beebe and retain consistent workflows for care teams.Overall scope of the proposed system(s) and services.Andor Health’s mission is to fundamentally change the way in which care teams, patients, and families connect and collaborate. By harnessing the latest innovations in AI and ML, our ThinkAndor Virtual Care Collaboration Suite allows healthcare institutions to quickly configure care team workflows and virtual health experiences leveraging ubiquitous collaboration platforms like Microsoft Teams. By optimizing collaboration and communication workflows, our platform helps healthcare systems increase access to care to patients, accelerate time to intervention, improves clinician productivity and scales clinical resources, and drives better patient outcomes. The ThinkAndor Virtual Care Collaboration Platform brings clinical orchestration and coordination across 5 key pillars of Virtual Health; Virtual Health Enablement, Virtual Rounding, Virtual Patient Monitoring, Virtual At Home Monitoring, and Virtual Team Collaboration. Designed with a proprietary role-based hierarchy and enterprise taxonomy, plus Digital Front Door experiences for both the patients and care team, healthcare systems can automate highly efficient workflows that empower clinicians in virtual care delivery. At Andor Health, we believe this ‘virtual clinical integration layer’ is the crux to solving the most impactful challenges facing healthcare institutions. The result is a frictionless, engaging, and positive virtual interaction allowing physicians and patients to communicate without being distracted by disjointed technology solutions that are often part of a virtual consultation.",
